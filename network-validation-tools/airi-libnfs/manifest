YOU NEED TO GENERATE A FILE NAMED "manifest" (no filename extension) BASED ON 
THE DATA THAT IS ON YOUR FLASHBLADE. 

THE "example-manifest" FILE WAS GENERATED ON A PURE FLASHBLADE AND CONTAINS 
FILES NAMES FROM MANY IMAGENET SUB-DIRECTORIES.

STEPS FOR CREATING YOUR VERSION OF THIS "manifest" FILE ARE IN THE "airi-libnfs" 
INSTRUCTION DOC SEs SHOULD HAVE.
